# AI Intake Approval Workflow
**Project:** Pickles GmbH — AI Governance Framework
**Stage:** Stage 2 — Governance Foundation
**Status:** Draft
**Version:** v1
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Assumptions:** Built on outline assumptions — not verified against real Pickles GmbH data

---

## Purpose

This workflow defines the mandatory gate process that every AI system must pass before it may be deployed by or on behalf of Pickles GmbH [ASSUMPTION — A-001, A-003]. No AI system may be used with real client data, integrated into client-facing products, or made accessible to external users until it has completed all gates in this workflow and received final Deployment Approval at Gate 6.

The workflow applies to:
- New AI systems being evaluated for procurement or development
- Existing AI systems undergoing substantive modification (EU AI Act Article 3)
- Third-party AI model integrations [ASSUMPTION — A-004]
- Internal AI tools that access or process personal data

**Regulatory basis:**
- EU AI Act Articles 3, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16-23 — Requirements prior to market placement
- EU AI Act Article 72 — Post-market monitoring obligations triggered at deployment
- GDPR Article 35 — Data Protection Impact Assessment prior to processing
- GDPR Article 36 — Prior consultation with BfDI where residual high risk
- GDPR Article 28 — Data Processing Agreement requirement before processing begins
- BDSG Section 67 — German DPIA requirements
- BDSG Section 69 — BfDI prior consultation (must be initiated at design stage, not post-deployment) [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED]
- BRAK Position Paper Section 2.1 — Human oversight requirements prior to AI deployment in legal practice
- ISO/IEC 42001 Clause 8.2 — AI risk and impact assessment requirements

## Gate Checklists

### Gate 1 — System Description

**Purpose:** Capture a complete system profile before any evaluation or risk assessment begins. A system cannot be registered in L1-3.1 or assessed against L1-3.2 without a complete Gate 1 profile.

**Responsible:** System owner (named individual) [ASSUMPTION — A-008]

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **System name** — the commercial or internal name of the system
- [ ] **Purpose and intended use** — what the system does; what problem it solves; who will use it
- [ ] **Deployment scope** — internal only, or customer-facing (triggering EU AI Act Article 50 obligations) [ASSUMPTION — A-006]
- [ ] **Model type** — e.g., LLM, RAG, classification model, rule-based system
- [ ] **Third-party model provider identified** [ASSUMPTION — A-004] — named provider or "to be confirmed at Gate 4"
- [ ] **Hosting location** [ASSUMPTION — A-005] — EU-based cloud, German data centre, third-party API, etc.
- [ ] **Data categories** — initial assessment of what personal data (if any) the system will process
- [ ] **Intended users** — Pickles GmbH staff only; lawyer clients; lawyer clients' end clients; all three
- [ ] **System owner named** — a specific named individual, not a job title, who will be responsible for ongoing compliance
- [ ] **Date of intake request** recorded

**Gate 1 pass criteria:** All fields above complete and internally consistent. No blanks permitted.

**Regulatory basis:** EU AI Act Article 11 (technical documentation requirements begin at intake); EU AI Act Article 13 (transparency and instructions for use must be designed from the start).

---

### Gate 2 — Risk Classification

**Purpose:** Assign a risk tier to the system using the Risk Classification Framework (L1-3.2). The tier determines all subsequent requirements. Risk classification must be confirmed before the system is registered in the AI System Inventory (L1-3.1) as anything other than "Pre-intake."

**Responsible:** Compliance Lead

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **Decision tree applied** — worked through all questions in L1-3.2 Section 3 in sequence
- [ ] **Prohibited use check completed** (L1-3.2 Q1) — confirm system does not fall within EU AI Act Article 5 prohibited practices; if yes, intake terminated and Legal notified
- [ ] **Tier assigned** — High (Tier 1), Medium (Tier 2), or Low (Tier 3)
- [ ] **Classification rationale documented** — specific criteria met or not met for each tier
- [ ] **[LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED for Tier 1]** — if Tier 1 classification is proposed, a qualified lawyer must review the classification before Gate 2 is passed; in particular Q2 (Annex III / Recital 61) and Q6 (specific-case reliance) require legal interpretation
- [ ] **Risk Classification field in L1-3.1 updated** with tier and classification date
- [ ] **Next gate requirements determined** based on tier (see Gate 3a below)

**Gate 2 pass criteria:** Tier assigned, rationale documented, and (for Tier 1) legal review completed. Classification entered in L1-3.1.

**Regulatory basis:** EU AI Act Articles 6, 9 (risk-based requirements apply from design stage); EU AI Act Annex III and Recital 61 (legal AI classification triggers); ISO/IEC 42001 Clause 8.2.

---

### Gate 3a — Data Review (Initial)

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **Personal data categories mapped** — list all categories the system will process: general personal data (GDPR Article 4); special categories (GDPR Article 9(1)); criminal convictions (GDPR Article 10); no personal data
- [ ] **Data subjects identified** — whose personal data: lawyer clients; their end clients; Pickles GmbH staff; third parties appearing in legal documents
- [ ] **Data flows documented** — where data enters the system, where it is processed, where it is stored, where it exits [ASSUMPTION — A-005 on hosting]
- [ ] **Sub-processors identified** — third-party model providers [ASSUMPTION — A-004] and any cloud infrastructure providers
- [ ] **DPIA trigger assessed** against GDPR Article 35 and BDSG Section 67 criteria:
  - [ ] Large-scale processing of special categories (Article 9(1)) or criminal data (Article 10)
  - [ ] Systematic and extensive profiling with legal or significant effects
  - [ ] Systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas (not applicable to legal AI — note only)
  - [ ] Other criteria in the BfDI or EDPB lists of processing operations requiring DPIA
- [ ] **DPIA trigger conclusion documented** — DPIA required / not required (with reasoning)

**Gate 3a pass criteria:** All data categories mapped. DPIA trigger assessment documented with conclusion.

**Regulatory basis:** GDPR Articles 35, 36; GDPR Article 28 (processor obligations triggered when personal data processing confirmed); BDSG Section 67.

---

### Gate 3b — Data Review (DPIA and Prior Consultation)

**Purpose:** Complete the DPIA where required and initiate BfDI prior consultation if residual risk remains high after mitigations. This gate is **mandatory for Tier 1 systems** and required for Tier 2 systems where Gate 3a determines a DPIA is triggered. Tier 3 systems with no personal data may proceed directly to Gate 4.

**Responsible:** DPO (with Legal and Engineering input) [ASSUMPTION — A-008]

**Responsible:** Legal (qualified lawyer with EU AI Act expertise) and Compliance Lead

**Checklist:**

**For all tiers:**
- [ ] **EU AI Act obligations confirmed** for the assigned risk tier — documentation, transparency, logging, human oversight requirements all planned and feasible
- [ ] **AI transparency disclosure designed** for customer-facing systems (EU AI Act Article 50) [ASSUMPTION — A-006]
- [ ] **Human oversight design reviewed** against L1-3.4 — confirm no fully automated legal advice output; mandatory review steps designed in
- [ ] **Legal review of classification rationale** for Tier 1 systems (if not already completed at Gate 2)

**Tier 1 additional requirements:**
- [ ] **Conformity assessment process initiated** (EU AI Act Articles 16-23) — internal conformity assessment or notified body assessment as applicable
- [ ] **Technical Documentation Pack initiated** (EU AI Act Article 11) — template L2-4.2
- [ ] **EU AI Act Article 13 transparency content drafted** — instructions for use, known limitations, human oversight requirements, intended purpose statement
- [ ] **Declaration of Conformity pathway confirmed** (EU AI Act Article 47)

**BRAK / professional obligation review (for lawyer-facing systems):**
- [ ] **Anwaltgeheimnis compliance assessed** — professional secrecy obligations satisfied [ASSUMPTION — A-002]
- [ ] **Section 43e BRAO IT outsourcing requirements satisfied** — where system relies on a third-party provider [ASSUMPTION — A-004] [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED]
- [ ] **BRAK professional liability framework reviewed** — responsibility allocation between Pickles GmbH and lawyer client documented

**Gate 4 pass criteria:** Legal sign-off documented. All Tier 1 conformity assessment steps initiated. Customer-facing transparency content drafted. No unresolved legal blockers.

---

## Substantive Modification Process

A deployed system that undergoes substantive modification must re-enter this workflow at the appropriate gate. A modification is **substantive** under EU AI Act Article 3(23) if it affects the intended purpose, the AI model or its performance, or the risk level of the system.

| Modification Type | Re-entry Point | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| Change to AI model architecture or provider | Gate 2 | Re-run full risk classification; may require new conformity assessment |
| Change in intended purpose or deployment scope | Gate 2 | Scope change may change risk tier |
| Change in data categories processed | Gate 3a | Re-assess DPIA trigger |
| Change from internal to customer-facing | Gate 2 | Likely triggers transparency obligations and tier upgrade |
| Change of third-party model provider [ASSUMPTION — A-004] | Gate 3b | New vendor DPA required; re-run L2-5.3 |
| Security or infrastructure change affecting logging | Gate 5 | Engineering re-sign-off required |
| Minor bug fix or performance change without scope change | No re-entry | Document in change log; confirm not substantive per Article 3(23) |

**[LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED]** The definition of "substantive modification" under EU AI Act Article 3(23) requires legal interpretation in each specific case. When in doubt, treat a modification as substantive and re-enter the workflow.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility in This Workflow |
|------|-------------------------------|
| **System Owner** (named individual) | Initiates intake; completes Gate 1; responsible for ongoing compliance post-deployment |
| **Compliance Lead** | Leads Gate 2 (risk classification) and Gate 4 (legal/regulatory review); final compliance sign-off for Tier 2 |
| **DPO** [ASSUMPTION — A-008] | Leads Gate 3a and Gate 3b (data review and DPIA); DPO sign-off for Tier 1 and any system triggering DPIA |
| **Legal** | Gate 4 legal review; Tier 1 classification review; BRAO/BRAK compliance confirmation |
| **Engineering Lead** | Gate 5 technical review; Engineering sign-off; post-deployment monitoring configuration |
| **CEO / C-suite** | Gate 6 final sign-off for Tier 1 systems only |

---

## Blocked System Protocol

If a system is blocked at any gate:

1. **Written blocking reason** produced by the gate reviewer within 2 business days of assessment
2. **Blocking reason communicated** to the system owner and recorded against the system in L1-3.1
3. **System status** remains "Development" or "Staging" — may not advance to Production
4. **Resolution pathway agreed** — system owner and gate reviewer agree remediation steps
5. **Re-assessment** — system re-presents at the blocked gate; previous gate completions remain valid unless the modification affects them

A system that is blocked and subsequently abandoned must have its L1-3.1 entry updated to "Suspended" or "Decommissioned" with a reason noted.

---

*This workflow is a governance control document. Completion of all gates is a prerequisite for deployment. No exceptions.*

> [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] The application of this workflow to specific Pickles GmbH systems requires legal review before operational use. In particular: Gate 2 risk classification for legal AI tools; Gate 3b BDSG Section 69 prior consultation timing; and Gate 4 Section 43e BRAO compliance for any system relying on a third-party AI model provider.
