## 1. Executive Summary

Pickles GmbH [ASSUMPTION] is a German legal technology provider offering AI-powered tools designed to support qualified legal professionals in research, drafting, summarisation, and structured legal analysis. Its systems are designed as assistive tools for lawyers and in-house legal teams — not as autonomous legal decision-makers.

AI governance is central to the trustworthiness of legal AI. Under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (EU AI Act), Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), and professional rules applicable to German lawyers (BRAO/BRAK), AI systems used in legal contexts must be carefully controlled, documented, and subject to meaningful human oversight. In addition, GDPR Article 5 requires accountability and demonstrable compliance with data protection principles.

This Information Pack summarises Pickles GmbH’s AI governance architecture as implemented through its multi-stage AI Governance Framework (Stages 1–4). It explains how systems are classified, documented, monitored, and reviewed, and how regulatory obligations — including EU AI Act Articles 9, 11, 13, 14, 31, 72; GDPR Articles 5, 22, 28, 32, 33, 35; and relevant BRAO/BRAK provisions — are operationalised.

This document is intended for non-technical legal procurement teams evaluating Pickles GmbH as a vendor. It provides a structured overview of compliance posture, risk management, transparency measures, and professional safeguards.

## 2. AI Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Assumed Product Portfolio

[ASSUMPTION] Based on the AI System Inventory (L1-3.1) and EU AI Act Risk Mapping Matrix (L2-4.1), Pickles GmbH operates the following AI system categories:

- **Legal Research Assistant (SYS-01)**  
  AI-supported retrieval and summarisation of case law and legislation.

- **Document Drafting Tool (SYS-02)**  
  AI-assisted drafting and auto-completion of contracts and legal documents.

- **Document Summarisation Tool (SYS-03)**  
  AI summarisation of lengthy legal documents and judgments.

- **Legal Analysis Tool (SYS-04)**  
  AI-supported structured legal analysis applied to specific fact patterns.

These descriptions are provisional and must be verified against the actual production architecture. [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED]

### 2.2 Architectural Principles

Across all systems, the following architectural principles apply:

1. **Registration Before Deployment**  
   No AI system may be deployed without prior registration in the AI System Inventory (EU AI Act Article 11; L1-3.1).

2. **Gate-Based Intake Process**  
   All systems must pass a six-gate approval workflow before production deployment (L1-3.3).

3. **Defined Intended Purpose**  
   Each system’s intended purpose is documented in technical documentation in line with Annex IV and Article 13(3)(b)(i) EU AI Act (L2-4.2).

4. **Human-in-the-Loop Design**  
   System outputs cannot bypass mandatory lawyer review prior to client-facing use (EU AI Act Article 14; GDPR Article 22; L1-3.4).

## 3. EU AI Act Compliance

### 3.1 Risk Classification Approach

Pickles GmbH applies a structured Risk Classification Framework (L1-3.2) aligned to:

- EU AI Act Article 6 (High-risk classification)
- Annex III (High-risk categories)
- Recitals 53 and 61 (legal AI interpretation)

Under Annex III Point 8(a), AI systems used by judicial authorities to apply law to concrete facts are classified as high-risk. [ASSUMPTION] Pickles GmbH sells to lawyers rather than judicial authorities; however, classification boundaries require legal review. [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED]

Where a system is determined to be high-risk:

- **Article 9** — A continuous risk management system is implemented.
- **Article 11 & Annex IV** — Full technical documentation is maintained.
- **Article 13** — Instructions for use and transparency documentation are provided.
- **Article 14** — Effective human oversight is designed into the system.
- **Article 72** — Post-market monitoring is mandatory.
- **Article 73** — Serious incidents must be reported.

### 3.2 Technical Documentation

For each system, Pickles GmbH prepares documentation structured to Annex IV requirements (L2-4.2), including:

- Intended purpose
- System architecture overview
- Training and validation approach [ASSUMPTION]
- Known limitations and accuracy constraints
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Logging and monitoring design (Article 12)

Documentation is version-controlled and updated upon substantial modification (Article 3(23); Article 43(4)).

### 3.3 Transparency Measures

Transparency is addressed at three levels (L2-4.3):

- **System-Level Transparency (Article 13)** — Deployer-facing instructions.
- **User-Level Transparency (Article 50)** — Disclosure when interacting with AI; labelling of AI-generated content (effective 2 August 2026).
- **Professional Transparency** — Alignment with BRAK Position Paper obligations.

## 4. Human Oversight Model

Human oversight is governed by the Human Oversight Policy (L1-3.4).

### 4.1 Core Principle

No AI output may constitute final legal advice without review and authorisation by a qualified lawyer.

This principle reflects:

- EU AI Act Article 14 (Human oversight)
- GDPR Article 22 (No solely automated decisions with legal effects)
- BRAO §43a(2) (Independent professional judgement)

### 4.2 Prohibited Practices

Prohibited practices include:

- Direct delivery of AI-generated advice to clients without review.
- Designing workflows that bypass human review.
- Representing AI output as independent legal advice.

[LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] The exact application of GDPR Article 22 in AI-assisted legal workflows must be assessed in context.

## 5. Data Protection Summary

### 5.1 Controller / Processor Model

Based on the Data Flow Map (L2-5.1):

- Pickles GmbH acts as **data controller** for employee and account data. [ASSUMPTION]
- Pickles GmbH acts as **data processor** for client-submitted legal documents. [ASSUMPTION]
- Third-party model providers may act as **sub-processors** (GDPR Article 28(2)). [ASSUMPTION]

[LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] Role allocation must be verified per GDPR Article 4(7)–(8).

### 5.2 Lawful Basis

Lawyer clients, as controllers, determine lawful basis under GDPR Article 6. Where special categories of data (Article 9) are processed, additional conditions apply.

### 5.3 DPIA Status

The DPIA Assessment (L2-5.2) confirms:

- High-risk systems require DPIA consideration (GDPR Article 35).
- SYS-04 is treated as requiring full DPIA. [ASSUMPTION]

### 5.4 Security Measures

Security controls are implemented in line with GDPR Article 32 and BDSG §64, including:

- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3+) [ASSUMPTION]
- Access controls and role-based permissions [ASSUMPTION]
- Sub-processor due diligence (L2-5.3)

---

## 6. Monitoring & Quality Assurance

Monitoring is governed by the AI Monitoring Framework (L3-6.1).

### 6.1 Key Metrics

Monitored metrics include:

- Hallucination / factual error rate
- Citation integrity
- User-reported accuracy concerns
- Incident frequency
- Model drift indicators

For high-risk systems, Article 72 requires structured post-market monitoring.

### 6.2 Incident Handling

The Incident Response Playbook (L3-6.2) defines:

- Severity levels (P1–P4)
- GDPR Article 33/34 breach notification timelines
- EU AI Act Article 73 serious incident reporting

### 6.3 Change Management

The Model Change Management Protocol (L3-6.3) governs:

- Change classification (Types A–F)
- Substantial modification assessment (Article 3(23))
- Conformity reassessment triggers (Article 43(4))

---

## 7. Professional Standards

Pickles GmbH aligns its governance architecture with:

- BRAO §43a(2) — Independent legal judgement
- BRAO §43e — IT outsourcing safeguards
- BRAK AI Position Paper (December 2024)

Where third-party providers are used, confidentiality obligations consistent with §43e BRAO are required (L2-5.3).
