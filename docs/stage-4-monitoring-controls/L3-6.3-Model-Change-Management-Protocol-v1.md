# Model Change Management Protocol
**Project:** Pickles GmbH — AI Governance Framework
**Stage:** Stage 4 — Monitoring & Operational Controls
**Status:** Draft
**Version:** v1
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Assumptions:** Built on outline assumptions — not verified against real Pickles GmbH data

---

## Purpose

This protocol governs all changes to Pickles GmbH's AI systems — whether initiated internally (prompt redesign, retraining, architectural changes) or externally (third-party model provider updates). It ensures that:

- Changes are tested before production deployment
- Substantial modifications triggering new EU AI Act conformity assessments are identified before deployment
- Clients are notified of changes affecting system behaviour
- A rollback plan exists for every production change
- The Technical Documentation Pack (L2-4.2) stays current

**Regulatory basis:**
- EU AI Act Article 3(23) — definition of substantial modification
- EU AI Act Article 43(4) — substantial modification triggers new conformity assessment
- EU AI Act Article 17(1)(a) — QMS must include procedures for management of modifications
- EU AI Act Article 9(2) — risk management system is an iterative process (changes require risk re-evaluation)
- EU AI Act Article 6(4) — self-assessment must be updated if classification changes
- ISO/IEC 42001 Clause 10 — continual improvement and corrective action

> [ASSUMPTION] The change governance roles and approval thresholds are based on the assumed organisational structure. They must be confirmed against real Pickles GmbH structure before operational use.

---

## 1. Change Classification Framework

Every proposed change must first be classified. Classification determines the approval path, testing requirements, and regulatory obligations.

### 1.1 Change Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Type A — Prompt redesign** | Changes to system prompts, instruction sets, or retrieval query logic — no model weight changes | Revised instruction wording; updated system prompt; modified retrieval parameters |
| **Type B — Configuration change** | Changes to system configuration, output formatting, safety filters, or operational parameters | Adjusting output length limit; enabling/disabling a feature; changing safety filter threshold |
| **Type C — Third-party model update** | New version of a third-party model API deployed by the provider | GPT-4o → GPT-4o-mini; Claude 3 → Claude 3.5; model version deprecation |
| **Type D — Fine-tuning / retraining** | Pickles GmbH fine-tunes, retrains, or trains a model on new data | Domain fine-tuning on new legal corpus; RLHF update |
| **Type E — Architecture change** | Changes to system architecture, infrastructure, or integration patterns | Switching from RAG to fine-tuning; replacing vector database; new API integration |
| **Type F — Provider switch** | Replacing the third-party AI model provider entirely | Switching from Provider A to Provider B |

### 1.2 Substantial Modification Assessment

EU AI Act Article 3(23) defines a substantial modification as a change that is:
1. **Not foreseen or planned** in the initial conformity assessment (see L2-4.2 Section 2.6 — pre-determined changes); AND
2. **Affects compliance** with Chapter III Section 2 requirements (Articles 9–15), OR **modifies the intended purpose** of the AI system

Article 43(4): pre-determined changes documented in Annex IV technical documentation (L2-4.2 Section 2.6) do NOT constitute substantial modification.

**Substantial modification classification matrix:**

| Change Type | Pre-determined? | Affects Ch. III S.2 or intended purpose? | Substantial Modification? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minor prompt wording adjustment within existing scope | Yes (if documented) | No | **No** |
| Prompt change that materially alters output type or scope | No | Yes (intended purpose affected) | **Yes** |
| Configuration change within pre-defined bounds | Yes (if documented) | No | **No** |
| Configuration change outside pre-defined bounds | No | Depends — assess | **Assess — likely Yes** |
| Third-party model version update (same capability class) | Possible — if update policy documented | May affect accuracy/robustness (Article 15) | **Assess** |
| Major model version change (new capability class) | No | Yes — accuracy, robustness, intended purpose | **Yes** |
| Fine-tuning on new domain data | No | May affect Article 10 data governance compliance | **Assess — likely Yes** |
| Architecture change affecting core processing | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Provider switch | No | Yes — new system with different characteristics | **Yes** |

> [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] Substantial modification assessments for SYS-04 have conformity assessment implications. A qualified EU AI Act practitioner must confirm the assessment for any Type C, D, E, or F change before deployment.

## 2. Change Request Process

### 2.1 Initiation

Any change to a Pickles GmbH AI system must begin with a **Change Request (CR)**. CRs may be raised by:
- Head of Engineering (technical changes)
- Head of Product (product changes)
- AIRO (governance-driven changes)
- Third-party model provider notification (Type C, F) — received per L2-5.3

**Change Request must document:**

```
CHANGE REQUEST — [CR-ID: CR-YYYY-MM-DD-NN]

System affected:
Change type (A/B/C/D/E/F):
Description of proposed change:
Reason for change:
Pre-determined change? (Y/N — reference L2-4.2 Section 2.6 if yes):
Raised by:
Date raised:
```

### 2.2 Initial Triage

The AIRO and Head of Engineering perform initial triage within **2 business days** of CR receipt:

| Triage Question | If Yes |
|---|---|
| Is this a pre-determined change (L2-4.2 Section 2.6)? | Expedited path — confirm in writing; proceed to Testing (Step 4) |
| Is this a Type C third-party update with vendor regression data? | Use vendor data to supplement internal testing; proceed to Assessment |
| Does the change affect the intended purpose of the system? | Substantial modification assessment required |
| Does the change affect SYS-04 (high-risk) accuracy, robustness, or data governance? | Substantial modification assessment required; notify Legal |

---

## 3. Substantial Modification Assessment

For any change not confirmed as pre-determined, complete the following assessment before testing:

```
SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION ASSESSMENT — [CR-ID]

1. Does this change modify the intended purpose of the system?
   (Intended purpose is defined in L2-4.2 Section 1.1 for each system)
   Yes / No / Uncertain [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED if Uncertain]

2. Does this change affect compliance with any of the following?
   Article 9 (risk management system): Yes / No
   Article 10 (data governance — if retraining): Yes / No
   Article 12 (logging capabilities): Yes / No
   Article 13 (transparency to deployers): Yes / No
   Article 14 (human oversight mechanisms): Yes / No
   Article 15 (accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity): Yes / No

3. Was this change foreseen and documented in L2-4.2 Section 2.6?
   Yes (reference: ___) / No

4. CONCLUSION
   Substantial modification: Yes / No / Requires legal review

   If Yes: New conformity assessment required before deployment (Article 43(4))
   Approved by (AIRO + Legal): ___        Date: ___
```

---

## 4. Testing Protocol

All changes — regardless of classification — undergo testing before production deployment. The depth of testing scales with change risk.

### 4.1 Testing Tiers

| Testing Tier | Applies To | Minimum Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 — Smoke test** | Type A minor prompt changes; Type B configuration within pre-defined bounds | Run benchmark query suite (n=20); confirm output format and quality unchanged; no regressions on known failure modes |
| **Tier 2 — Standard regression** | Type A major prompt changes; Type B outside pre-defined bounds; Type C minor model updates | Full benchmark query suite (n=100); citation accuracy check; latency check; human review of 10 sampled outputs by a qualified legal reviewer [ASSUMPTION] |
| **Tier 3 — Full regression** | Type C major model updates; Type D (fine-tuning); Type E (architecture); Type F (provider switch) | Full benchmark query suite (n=200+); citation accuracy; bias check across document types; latency; safety filter validation; human review of 25+ outputs by qualified legal reviewer; AIRO sign-off before staging deployment |
| **Tier 4 — Full regression + third-party validation** | Substantial modifications requiring new conformity assessment | All Tier 3 requirements + independent third-party accuracy assessment + new Annex IV technical documentation + conformity assessment before production deployment [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] |

### 4.2 Benchmark Query Suite

[ASSUMPTION] The benchmark query suite is a curated set of test queries covering:
- Standard legal research queries across Pickles GmbH's primary practice area coverage
- Known edge cases and failure modes identified in previous incidents and monitoring
- Citation-heavy queries (for accuracy testing)
- Multilingual queries if system supports multiple languages
- Queries designed to probe bias and differential performance

The benchmark suite is maintained by the Head of Product and updated after every P1/P2 incident and every major model change. [ASSUMPTION]

### 4.3 Regression Testing Pass Criteria

A change passes regression testing and may proceed to staging if:

| Criterion | Pass Standard |
|---|---|
| Citation accuracy | ≥95% on benchmark suite (no regression from previous baseline) |
| Error rate | ≤2% expert-identified errors in human review sample |
| Latency | P95 response time within 10% of previous baseline |
| No new failure modes | No failure modes not present in previous baseline |
| Safety filter | No outputs violating content safety requirements |
| Bias check (Tier 3/4) | No statistically significant performance degradation in any tested stratum |

### 4.4 Staging Deployment

Before production deployment, all Tier 2+ changes must be deployed in a staging environment for a minimum period:
- Tier 2: 2 business days
- Tier 3: 5 business days
- Tier 4: As required by conformity assessment timelines

---

## 5. Sign-Off Authority

| Change Tier | Sign-Off Required |
|---|---|
| Tier 1 | Head of Engineering |
| Tier 2 | Head of Engineering + Head of Product |
| Tier 3 | Head of Engineering + Head of Product + AIRO |
| Tier 4 (Substantial modification) | AIRO + CEO + Legal (plus conformity assessment body if applicable) |

No change to SYS-04 (high-risk) may be deployed to production without AIRO sign-off, regardless of tier.

---

## 6. Rollback Plan

Every change deployed to production must have a documented rollback plan approved before deployment.

### 6.1 Rollback Requirement

```
ROLLBACK PLAN — [CR-ID]

Previous version/configuration:
Rollback method (how to revert to previous state):
Rollback owner:
Maximum rollback time (from decision to complete):
Rollback trigger conditions:
  - Automatic (monitoring threshold breach): [specify]
  - Manual (AIRO or Head of Engineering decision): [specify]
Data implications of rollback (any data created during new version that is affected):
Client notification required on rollback? (Y/N):
```

### 6.2 Rollback Decision Authority

| Situation | Rollback Decision Authority |
|---|---|
| Automated monitoring alert (L3-6.1) triggering rollback condition | Head of Engineering — may initiate immediately |
| P1 incident linked to recent change | AIRO — may order immediate rollback |
| P2 incident with probable link to recent change | AIRO + Head of Engineering — joint decision |
| Regulatory authority instruction (Article 79) | CEO + Legal — mandatory compliance |

### 6.3 Post-Rollback Actions

Following any rollback:
1. Incident log opened (minimum P2)
2. Root cause analysis initiated (L3-6.2 RCA template)
3. Technical documentation updated to record rolled-back change (L2-4.2 Section 6)
4. CR closed as failed; new CR required for revised approach

---

## 7. Specific Change Scenarios

### 7.1 Third-Party Model Provider Update (Type C)

When a provider notifies Pickles GmbH of a model update per L2-5.3 Section 7:

| Step | Action | Owner | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Log provider notification; open CR | Head of Engineering | Day 0 |
| 2 | Review provider release notes; classify as minor or major update | Head of Engineering + Head of Product | Day 1–2 |
| 3 | Assign testing tier (Tier 2 for minor; Tier 3 for major) | AIRO | Day 2 |
| 4 | Run regression testing in isolated environment | Head of Engineering | Per tier requirements |
| 5 | Substantial modification assessment | AIRO + Legal | During testing |
| 6 | Staging deployment and monitoring | Head of Engineering | Post-testing |
| 7 | Sign-off and production deployment | Per Section 5 | After staging |
| 8 | Update L2-4.2 Section 6 (lifecycle change log) | Head of Engineering | At deployment |
| 9 | Client notification if behaviour materially changes | Head of Product | Before or at deployment |

### 7.2 Prompt Redesign (Type A)

Minor prompt changes may follow an expedited path if they are documented as pre-determined in L2-4.2 Section 2.6. All others follow the standard CR process with Tier 1 or Tier 2 testing.

### 7.3 Provider Switch (Type F)

A complete provider switch is always a substantial modification requiring Tier 4 testing and new conformity assessment for SYS-04. Additionally:
- New DPA must be executed with the new provider (L2-5.3)
- §43e BRAO service agreement required
- SCCs assessed if new provider is non-EEA
- Client notification required before switch

### 7.4 Retraining / Fine-Tuning (Type D)

Any retraining or fine-tuning on new data requires:
- Data governance review under EU AI Act Article 10 (training data quality, bias examination)
- L2-4.2 Section 2.4 (training data) updated
- Bias assessment (M-05) run on new model before production
- Tier 3 or Tier 4 testing depending on scope
