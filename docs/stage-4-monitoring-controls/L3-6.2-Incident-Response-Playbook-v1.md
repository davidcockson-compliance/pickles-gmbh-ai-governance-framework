# Incident Response Playbook
**Project:** Pickles GmbH — AI Governance Framework
**Stage:** Stage 4 — Monitoring & Operational Controls
**Status:** Draft
**Version:** v1
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Assumptions:** Built on outline assumptions — not verified against real Pickles GmbH data

---

## Purpose

This playbook defines how Pickles GmbH identifies, classifies, escalates, and resolves incidents involving its AI systems. It covers:
- Internal incident management (all systems)
- EU AI Act Article 73 serious incident reporting obligations (SYS-04, high-risk)
- GDPR Article 33/34 personal data breach notification
- BDSG §65/66 breach notification under German law
- Client notification requirements
- Root cause analysis template

> [ASSUMPTION] Contact details, escalation paths, and authority assignments are placeholder — must be completed with real names and roles before operational use.

> [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] Regulatory reporting obligations under Article 73 and GDPR Article 33 are time-critical and carry legal consequences for non-compliance. This playbook must be reviewed by a qualified legal practitioner before it is relied upon operationally.

## 1. Incident Definition

### 1.1 What Is an Incident

For the purposes of this playbook, an **incident** is any unplanned event or pattern affecting a Pickles GmbH AI system that:
- Causes or risks causing harm to a user, client, or third party
- Represents a material failure of the system to operate within its intended purpose
- Triggers a regulatory reporting or notification obligation
- Results in a personal data breach
- Causes or risks causing reputational, financial, or legal harm to Pickles GmbH

Monitoring alerts from L3-6.1 that breach defined thresholds are the primary source of incident triggers.

### 1.2 EU AI Act Serious Incident Definition

Article 3(49) defines a **serious incident** as an incident or malfunctioning of an AI system that directly or indirectly leads to:
- **(a)** The death of a person, or serious harm to a person's health
- **(b)** A serious and irreversible disruption of the management or operation of critical infrastructure
- **(c)** The infringement of obligations under Union law intended to protect fundamental rights
- **(d)** Serious harm to property or the environment

> **For Pickles GmbH:** Article 3(49)(c) — infringement of fundamental rights obligations — is the most likely serious incident category. A materially flawed SYS-04 legal analysis output that is relied upon in legal proceedings without adequate lawyer review, and that causes a demonstrable infringement of a party's right to a fair trial or effective legal representation, could constitute a serious incident under this definition. [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED]

### 1.3 GDPR Personal Data Breach Definition

A **personal data breach** (GDPR Article 4(12)) is a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.

---

## 2. Incident Examples by System

| Example Incident | System | Likely Classification |
|---|---|---|
| AI output contains a fabricated case citation relied upon by a lawyer in a court submission | SYS-01, SYS-04 | P1 / potential Article 3(49)(c) serious incident |
| SYS-04 produces systematically flawed analysis for a specific document type (discovered via M-01) | SYS-04 | P1 — immediate investigation; possible Article 20 corrective action |
| User-reported error rate spikes above threshold; root cause unknown | Any system | P2 — investigation; possible escalation to P1 |
| Third-party model provider suffers security breach; client query data may be exposed | SYS-04 | P1 — GDPR Article 33 clock starts; potential Article 73 implications |
| System returns outputs containing personal data from a different user's session (data isolation failure) | Any system | P1 — GDPR Article 33 breach notification; potential data subject notification |
| Unauthorised model drift detected: outputs changed without authorised update | SYS-04 | P2 — activate L3-6.3; assess Article 20/73 |
| Planned maintenance window overruns; system unavailable for 4 hours | Any system | P3 — client notification; no regulatory trigger |
| Single user complaint about output quality; no pattern detected | Any system | P4 — log and investigate; no escalation |

---

## 3. Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Examples | Response Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1 — Critical** | Actual or probable serious harm to a person; potential Article 3(49) serious incident; confirmed personal data breach; Article 20 non-conformity | Fabricated legal citation in court submission; data breach exposing client personal data; SYS-04 systemic failure | Immediate — within 1 hour of detection |
| **P2 — High** | Material quality failure without confirmed harm; unplanned model drift; suspected (unconfirmed) data breach; pattern of errors meeting L3-6.1 alert thresholds | Spike in user error reports; citation accuracy below 90%; unauthorised model drift detected | Within 4 business hours of detection |
| **P3 — Medium** | Degraded performance affecting users; planned maintenance overruns; single client escalation with potential pattern | System latency exceeding SLA; extended planned downtime; second client complaint in same category within 30 days | Within 1 business day |
| **P4 — Low** | Isolated user complaint; minor quality issue; no threshold breach; no harm | Single user error report; cosmetic output formatting issue; feature request misidentified as defect | Within 3 business days |

## 4. Escalation Paths

### P1 — Critical Incident Escalation

```
Detection (L3-6.1 monitoring / user report / deployer notification)
    │
    ▼ Within 15 minutes
Head of Engineering — confirmed? → If not confirmed: investigate; escalate if confirmed
    │
    ▼ Within 1 hour
AIRO notified — initiates P1 incident log; assigns Incident Commander
    │
    ├─► CEO notified immediately
    ├─► DPO notified immediately (if data breach suspected)
    └─► Legal counsel notified (if Article 73 or GDPR reporting may be required)
    │
    ▼ Within 2 hours
Regulatory clock assessment:
    ├─► EU AI Act Article 73 trigger? → If yes: prepare report; see Section 6
    └─► GDPR Article 33 trigger? → If yes: 72-hour clock starts; see Section 7
    │
    ▼ Ongoing
Incident log updated every 2 hours until resolution
Client notification assessed — see Section 8
System suspension decision if harm ongoing (Article 20)
```

### P2 — High Severity Escalation

Head of Engineering → Head of Product → AIRO (within 4 hours) → CEO (if Article 20 obligations may arise) → DPO (if data-related)

### P3 — Medium Severity

Head of Engineering → Head of Product → client notification if SLA breach → AIRO weekly summary

### P4 — Low Severity

Head of Product → logged in incident register → reviewed in monthly monitoring report

## 5. Regulatory Reporting Triggers

### 5.1 EU AI Act Article 73 — Serious Incident Reporting (SYS-04 Only)

Article 73 applies to SYS-04 (high-risk) only. Reporting is to the market surveillance authority of the Member State where the incident occurred. [ASSUMPTION] For Pickles GmbH, the competent German market surveillance authority must be identified and contact details maintained. [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED — confirm which authority is competent for SYS-04 in Germany]

**Reporting trigger:** Reasonable likelihood that the incident is causally linked to SYS-04, AND the incident meets the Article 3(49) serious incident definition.

| Incident Type | Reporting Deadline | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Standard serious incident (Art. 3(49)(a)(c)(d)) | **15 days** from provider awareness of causal link or reasonable likelihood | Initial report may be incomplete (Art. 73(5)) |
| Widespread infringement OR critical infrastructure (Art. 3(49)(b)) | **2 days** from awareness | Immediate notification |
| Death of a person (Art. 3(49)(a)) | **10 days** from awareness; immediate when causal link suspected | Highest priority |

**Post-notification obligations (Article 73(6)):**
- Immediately investigate incident and AI system
- Conduct risk assessment of incident
- Take corrective action
- Cooperate with competent authorities
- Do NOT alter the AI system in ways that may affect evaluation of incident causes before informing authorities

**Article 20 non-conformity trigger:**
If the incident indicates SYS-04 is not in conformity with the EU AI Act, Article 20 requires:
- Immediate corrective action (up to and including withdrawal/recall)
- Notification to deployers (lawyer clients)
- If Article 79(1) risk: inform market surveillance authority

### 5.2 GDPR Article 33 — Data Breach Notification to Supervisory Authority

**Trigger:** A personal data breach has occurred (GDPR Article 4(12) definition met).

**Deadline:** Without undue delay and, where feasible, **not later than 72 hours** after becoming aware of the breach.

**Supervisory authority:** [ASSUMPTION] For Pickles GmbH: the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (Bundesbeauftragter für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit — BfDI), or the relevant Landesbeauftragter depending on Pickles GmbH's registration. [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED]

**Report must include (Article 33(3)):**
- Nature of the breach including categories and approximate number of data subjects and records
- Name and contact details of the DPO
- Likely consequences of the breach
- Measures taken or proposed to address the breach

**Exception:** Notification not required if the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

**BDSG §65 parallel obligation:** Same 72-hour deadline applies to notification to the Federal Commissioner under the BDSG framework for processing under Part 3 BDSG. [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED — confirm which regime applies]

### 5.3 GDPR Article 34 — Data Breach Notification to Data Subjects

**Trigger:** Personal data breach is likely to result in **high risk** to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

**Deadline:** Without undue delay.

**Exemptions (Article 34(3)):**
- Affected data was encrypted and unintelligible to unauthorised persons
- Subsequent measures have eliminated the high risk
- Disproportionate effort — public communication instead

**BDSG §66 parallel obligation:** Where the breach results in substantial risk to legally protected interests of natural persons, data subjects must be notified without delay. [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED]

## 8. Client Notification Requirements

### 8.1 When to Notify Clients

[ASSUMPTION] Pickles GmbH notifies lawyer clients in the following circumstances:

| Situation | Notification Trigger | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| P1 incident affecting client data or outputs | Mandatory | As soon as practical; before regulatory notification where possible |
| P1 incident where client may have relied on affected outputs | Mandatory | Within 24 hours of classification |
| System suspension under Article 20 | Mandatory | Immediately; before or concurrent with suspension |
| GDPR personal data breach involving client data | Mandatory (and client's own GDPR Article 33 clock may start) | Without undue delay — client needs information to meet their own obligations as controller |
| P2 quality incident with pattern affecting client's practice area | Recommended | Within 2 business days |
| P3 SLA breach | Per contractual SLA terms | Per SLA |

### 8.2 Client Notification Content (P1)

A P1 client notification must include:
- Description of the incident in plain language
- Systems and outputs affected
- Period during which affected outputs were produced
- Whether client's data was involved (and what categories if so)
- Actions Pickles GmbH has taken
- Actions the client should take (e.g., review outputs from the affected period)
- Contact point for further information (DPO for data-related; AIRO for AI-related)

---

## 9. Post-Incident Review

Every P1 and P2 incident triggers a post-incident review within 30 days of resolution:
- AIRO presents RCA findings to CEO and relevant heads
- Monitoring thresholds reviewed for adequacy
- Playbook updated if gaps identified
- If Article 73 was triggered: review whether reporting was timely and complete
- ISO/IEC 42001 Clause 10.2 corrective action documented

---

## Document Control
