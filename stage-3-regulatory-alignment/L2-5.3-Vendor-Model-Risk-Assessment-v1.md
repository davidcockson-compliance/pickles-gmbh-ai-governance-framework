# Vendor Model Risk Assessment
**Project:** Pickles GmbH — AI Governance Framework
**Stage:** Stage 3 — Regulatory Alignment
**Status:** Draft
**Version:** v1
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Assumptions:** Built on outline assumptions — not verified against real Pickles GmbH data

---

## Purpose

This document provides a framework for assessing and managing the risks associated with third-party AI model providers used by Pickles GmbH. It covers:

1. Data processing agreement (DPA) requirements under GDPR Article 28
2. Attorney-client confidentiality requirements under §43e BRAO (as mediated through Pickles GmbH's service to lawyer clients)
3. Sub-processor selection criteria and due diligence checklist
4. International data transfer risk and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
5. Security review checklist
6. Model update monitoring requirements

> [ASSUMPTION A-004] This document is premised on the assumption that Pickles GmbH uses at least one third-party AI model provider whose API receives data that may include personal data from lawyer client queries. If Pickles GmbH runs all AI inference in-house with no external model API calls, sections relating to third-party providers are not applicable — but the document should be updated to confirm this.

> [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] The contractual and regulatory obligations described in this document require legal review before implementation. DPAs and SCCs are legal instruments — their execution must be overseen by a qualified legal practitioner.

## 2. Third-Party Model Provider Risk Profile

### 2.1 Risk Context

Third-party AI model providers occupy a uniquely sensitive position in the Pickles GmbH data flow for two independent reasons:

**Reason 1 — GDPR sub-processor risk:**
Queries submitted to a model API may contain personal data of the lawyer client's own clients (natural persons whose legal matters are being analysed). These data subjects have no direct relationship with Pickles GmbH or the model provider. If the model provider retains, logs, or uses this data for training without authorisation, Pickles GmbH and its lawyer clients face GDPR liability.

**Reason 2 — §43e BRAO attorney-client confidentiality risk:**
The BRAK AI Position Paper (Section 3.2) confirms that passing client secrets to a model provider, even if the provider does not actually read the information, constitutes a potential disclosure under §203(1)(3) StGB (breach of professional secrecy). The mere opportunity for access is sufficient. Pickles GmbH therefore bears a duty to ensure that any model provider receiving data from lawyer queries has contractual confidentiality obligations meeting §43e BRAO standards.

**Reason 3 — EU AI Act value chain obligations:**
EU AI Act Article 25(4) requires that where a third party supplies an AI system, tools, or services integrated into a high-risk AI system, the provider and third party must have a **written agreement** specifying the information, capabilities, and technical access necessary for the provider to comply with EU AI Act obligations.

This obligation applies explicitly to SYS-04 (high-risk) and creates a separate contractual requirement alongside GDPR Article 28 DPA obligations.

## 5. International Data Transfer Risk Assessment

### 5.1 Transfer Risk by Provider Location

[ASSUMPTION A-004] The location of Pickles GmbH's third-party model provider is unknown. The following risk assessment applies by provider location:

| Provider Location | GDPR Transfer Mechanism | §43e(4) BRAO Assessment | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| Germany | No cross-border transfer; GDPR applies | German confidentiality law fully applicable | **Lowest** — Preferred per BRAK guidance |
| EU/EEA (non-Germany) | No Chapter V mechanism required; GDPR applies | Comparable confidentiality protection | **Low** |
| UK | Adequacy decision (UK GDPR Adequacy Decision, June 2021) — review ongoing | Adequate confidentiality framework | **Low-Medium** — monitor adequacy decision status |
| USA (Data Privacy Framework participants) | EU-US Data Privacy Framework (adequacy decision July 2023) | Comparable protection uncertain for legal confidentiality | **Medium** — TIA still recommended; §43e(4) assessment required |
| USA (non-DPF) | SCCs required (Commission Decision 2021/914) + TIA | Comparable protection uncertain | **High** — TIA + SCCs required; consider alternative providers |
| Other third countries (no adequacy) | SCCs + TIA required; possible derogations under Article 49 | §43e(4) requires special protective measures | **Very High** — legal review required before use |

### 5.2 Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) Requirement

Where Pickles GmbH uses a non-EEA model provider, it must conduct a Transfer Impact Assessment per EDPB Recommendations 01/2020. The TIA must:

1. Assess the legal framework of the destination country — whether laws permit government access to transferred data in ways incompatible with GDPR
2. Evaluate whether SCCs are effective in the destination country given the legal context
3. Identify whether supplementary measures are needed (technical, contractual, or organisational)
4. Document the assessment and the conclusion

[LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] A TIA for major AI model provider jurisdictions (particularly the USA) requires specialist legal input. Pickles GmbH cannot conduct a TIA without a qualified data protection practitioner familiar with international transfer law.

### 5.3 SCC Module Selection

If SCCs are required, the correct module from Commission Decision 2021/914 must be selected:

| Transfer Scenario | SCC Module |
|---|---|
| Pickles GmbH (controller) → model provider (processor) — for user account data | **Module 2: Controller to Processor** |
| Pickles GmbH (processor for lawyer clients) → model provider (sub-processor) — for client query data | **Module 3: Processor to Processor** |

[LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] The correct module depends on the confirmed controller/processor analysis per L2-5.1 Section 2.

## 7. Model Update Monitoring

### 7.1 Why Model Updates Are High-Risk for Legal AI

Third-party AI model providers regularly update their models. For a legal AI provider like Pickles GmbH, model updates carry particular risks:

- **Accuracy regression:** An updated model may perform worse on legal citation accuracy or legal reasoning tasks
- **Behavioural changes:** Output style, length, or safety filtering may change without warning
- **Capability changes:** A model update could expand or restrict the model's ability to handle certain legal topics
- **EU AI Act implications:** Substantial changes to a third-party model that is integrated into a high-risk system (SYS-04) may require re-assessment under EU AI Act Article 6(2) and Article 17

For a full model update management protocol, see L3-6.3. This section addresses the vendor-specific monitoring obligations.

### 7.2 Required Contractual Commitments from Model Providers

| # | Commitment | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| MU-01 | Provider gives advance notice (minimum 30 days [ASSUMPTION]) of material model updates affecting output quality, accuracy, safety, or API behaviour | EU AI Act Article 25(4); good practice |
| MU-02 | Provider maintains version-locked API access for a defined period (e.g., 6–12 months) after a new model version is deployed | Good practice; operational continuity |
| MU-03 | Provider publishes release notes and changelog for each model update | Transparency; EU AI Act Article 25(4) |
| MU-04 | Provider cooperates with Pickles GmbH's regression testing on updated models before production deployment | Good practice; EU AI Act Article 9(6) |
| MU-05 | Provider notifies Pickles GmbH of security vulnerabilities or adversarial risk disclosures affecting the model | EU AI Act Article 15(5); GDPR Article 32 |

### 7.3 Pickles GmbH's Internal Model Update Response Process

When a third-party model provider announces a material update, Pickles GmbH must:

| Step | Action | Owner [ASSUMPTION] | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Receive provider update notification | Head of Engineering [ASSUMPTION] | Before update deployment |
| 2 | Assess whether update constitutes a material change under L3-6.3 criteria | Head of Product + Engineering [ASSUMPTION] | Within 5 business days of notification |
| 3 | Conduct regression testing on benchmark legal query suite | Head of Engineering [ASSUMPTION] | Before production deployment |
| 4 | Assess EU AI Act implications (Article 6(2) substantial modification?) | Legal / AIRO [ASSUMPTION] | Before production deployment |
| 5 | Update Technical Documentation Pack (L2-4.2 Section 6) to record change | Head of Engineering [ASSUMPTION] | At point of deployment |
| 6 | Deploy update in staging environment; validate outputs | Head of Engineering [ASSUMPTION] | Before production deployment |
| 7 | Deploy to production with monitoring | Head of Engineering [ASSUMPTION] | After validation |
| 8 | Notify lawyer clients of material model changes affecting system behaviour [ASSUMPTION] | Client Success / Legal [ASSUMPTION] | Per client notification obligations in DPA |

Full change management process is documented in L3-6.3-Model-Change-Management-Protocol-v1.md.

## 9. Provider Non-Compliance Response

If a third-party model provider fails to meet minimum criteria (Section 3.1), or is found to be in breach of DPA terms:

| Severity | Response |
|---|---|
| **Critical breach** (e.g., data training without consent; confidentiality breach) | Suspend API use immediately; notify lawyer clients per DPA terms; notify DPO; assess GDPR breach notification obligations; consider supervisory authority notification; engage legal counsel |
| **Material non-compliance** (e.g., failure to delete data; sub-processor not authorised) | Issue formal notice to provider; set cure period (maximum 30 days [ASSUMPTION]); escalate to suspension if not cured |
| **Procedural non-compliance** (e.g., late update notification) | Issue formal notice; document; review at next scheduled vendor assessment |

Per §43e(2) BRAO: if confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, "cooperation must be terminated immediately."
