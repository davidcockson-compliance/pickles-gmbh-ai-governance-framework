# EU AI Act Risk Mapping Matrix
**Project:** Pickles GmbH — AI Governance Framework
**Stage:** Stage 3 — Regulatory Alignment
**Status:** Draft
**Version:** v1
**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Assumptions:** Built on outline assumptions — not verified against real Pickles GmbH data

---

## Purpose

This document maps Pickles GmbH's assumed AI systems against the EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) risk classification framework. For each system, it identifies: the applicable risk tier, relevant articles, documentation requirements, and transparency obligations.

**Scope of this document:** EU AI Act obligations only. GDPR/BDSG data protection obligations are addressed in L2-5.1 through L2-5.3.

> [ASSUMPTION] This matrix is built entirely on the assumed product line described in CLAUDE.md Section 2 (A-001). The actual Pickles GmbH product portfolio has not been verified. Before this matrix is used operationally, each system must be reviewed against the real product architecture.

> [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] Risk classification under the EU AI Act is a legal determination. This matrix constitutes a preliminary analytical framework, not a compliance certification. A qualified legal practitioner familiar with EU AI Act implementation must review classifications before reliance.

## 1. EU AI Act Risk Tier Framework

The EU AI Act uses a four-tier risk model. The applicable tier determines which obligations apply.

| Tier | Risk Level | Primary Trigger | Applicable Articles |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Prohibited** | Systems posing unacceptable risks to fundamental rights | Article 5 |
| 2 | **High-risk** | Systems listed in Annex III, or safety components under Annex I legislation | Articles 8–27, 49 |
| 3 | **Limited-risk** (transparency obligations) | AI systems interacting with humans, generating synthetic content, or processing biometric/emotional data | Article 50 |
| 4 | **Minimal-risk** | All other AI systems | Voluntary codes only |

---

## 2. Annex III High-Risk Classification Assessment

Article 6(2) designates systems in Annex III as high-risk. For legal AI providers, the most relevant Annex III entry is:

> **Annex III, Point 8(a):** "AI systems intended to be used by a judicial authority or on their behalf to assist a judicial authority in researching and interpreting facts and the law and in applying the law to a concrete set of facts, or to be used in a similar way in alternative dispute resolution."

**Critical interpretation for Pickles GmbH:**

The note at Annex III Point 8(a) in the stage-3 regulatory extracts confirms that this classification applies to *judicial authorities* — courts, tribunals, arbitrators acting in a judicial capacity. It does **not** automatically apply to AI systems used by lawyers advising clients, even where those lawyers subsequently appear before judicial authorities.

[ASSUMPTION] Pickles GmbH's clients are law firms and in-house legal departments (A-002), not judicial authorities. Subject to verification, Pickles GmbH's systems provisionally do not fall under Annex III Point 8(a).

However, the following circumstances could change this assessment:
- If Pickles GmbH markets to, or sells to, judicial bodies or court-appointed experts [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED]
- If output from Pickles GmbH systems is directly integrated into judicial decision workflows without intermediate lawyer review [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED]

**Article 6(3) Derogation Check:**

Even if a system appeared in Annex III, Article 6(3) provides that it shall *not* be considered high-risk where it:
- Performs a narrow procedural task (Article 6(3)(a))
- Improves the result of a previously completed human activity (Article 6(3)(b))
- Detects patterns without replacing human assessment without proper human review (Article 6(3)(c))
- Performs a preparatory task to an assessment (Article 6(3)(d))

> **Note:** Article 6(3) does not apply if the system performs profiling of natural persons (Article 6(3) final subparagraph). Legal research and drafting systems are unlikely to perform profiling, but this must be confirmed per system.

## 5. Article 50 Transparency Obligations — All Systems

Regardless of high-risk classification, Article 50 applies to all Pickles GmbH AI systems in the following circumstances:

| Obligation | Trigger | Systems Affected | Action Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Article 50(1) — AI interaction disclosure | System "intended to interact directly with natural persons" | SYS-01, SYS-02, SYS-03, SYS-04 [ASSUMPTION] | Inform users at first interaction that they are interacting with an AI system |
| Article 50(1) — Exemption | Disclosure not required if AI nature is "obvious" from context to a reasonably well-informed user | All systems — assess per system | [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] whether lawyer-facing AI tool interaction is "obvious" |
| Article 50(2) — Synthetic content marking | System generates synthetic audio, image, video or text content | SYS-02 (drafts), SYS-03 (summaries), SYS-04 (analysis outputs) [ASSUMPTION] | Outputs must be marked in machine-readable format as AI-generated |
| Article 50(2) — Assistive exemption | Does not apply where system performs "assistive function for standard editing" | SYS-02 — partial exemption possible; SYS-03, SYS-04 — less clear [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] | Legal review required per system |
| Article 50(5) — Timing | Disclosure must be provided "at the latest at the time of the first interaction or exposure" | All systems | Implement at onboarding / first login |

---

## 6. Value Chain Obligations

Article 25 imposes obligations on the AI value chain, relevant where Pickles GmbH uses third-party AI model providers:

[ASSUMPTION] Pickles GmbH may use third-party AI model providers (A-004). If so:

| Obligation | Basis | Action Required |
|---|---|---|
| Pickles GmbH must treat itself as a provider under Article 16 if it substantially modifies a third-party AI system or places its brand on it | Article 25(1)(a)(b) | Confirm modification scope with model providers [ASSUMPTION] |
| Written agreement with third-party providers must specify information, technical access, and capabilities needed for Pickles GmbH to comply with EU AI Act | Article 25(4) | Include in vendor contracts — see L2-5.3 |
| If third-party model is a general-purpose AI model (GPAI), additional Chapter V obligations may apply to the GPAI provider | Articles 51–56 | Review model provider's compliance status [ASSUMPTION] |

---

## 7. Article 4 — AI Competence Obligation

Article 4 applies from 2 February 2025 and is not contingent on high-risk classification. It requires that Pickles GmbH:

> Take measures to ensure, to the best of their ability, that their personnel and other persons involved in the operation and use of AI systems on their behalf have a sufficient level of AI competence.

Per the BRAK AI Position Paper (December 2024), AI competence requirements also apply to lawyers as operators of AI systems under Article 3(4) EU AI Act. Pickles GmbH's client-facing materials should therefore support clients' own Article 4 compliance.

[ASSUMPTION] Pickles GmbH's internal AI competence training programme has not been verified. See L1-3.1 and L1-3.4 for related governance structures.
