# AI System Inventory
**Project:** Pickles GmbH — AI Governance Framework
**Stage:** Stage 2 — Governance Foundation
**Status:** Draft
**Version:** v1
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Assumptions:** Built on outline assumptions — not verified against real Pickles GmbH data

## Purpose

This document is the master register of all AI systems operated or deployed by Pickles GmbH [ASSUMPTION — A-001, A-003]. It is the primary reference for risk governance, compliance obligations, and operational oversight across all AI systems.

This register must be maintained as a living document. Every AI system used in production — whether internally developed, procured from a third party, or based on a third-party foundation model — must be registered here before deployment. **Unregistered systems must not be deployed.**

**Regulatory basis:**
- EU AI Act Article 11 — Technical documentation requirements for high-risk AI systems
- EU AI Act Article 12 — Logging and event recording requirements
- EU AI Act Article 13 — Transparency and instructions for use
- EU AI Act Article 72 — Post-market monitoring
- ISO/IEC 42001 Clause A.6 — AI system lifecycle documentation

## How to Use This Register

| Action | Instruction |
|--------|-------------|
| New system intake | Complete a new row when a system passes Gate 1 of the AI Intake Approval Workflow (L1-3.3). Risk Classification must be assigned at Gate 2. |
| Risk classification | Use the Risk Classification Framework (L1-3.2) to assign High / Medium / Low tier. |
| Updates | Any change to system name, model type, hosting location, data categories, or deployment status must be reflected within 5 business days. |
| Substantive modifications | Modifications that may affect compliance with EU AI Act requirements (Article 3) must trigger re-classification and re-registration. |
| Decommissioning | Update Deployment Status to "Decommissioned" and record the date. Do not delete rows — retain for audit. |

| System Name | Current Stage | Date Added | Responsible Person |
|------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| [PLACEHOLDER] | Pre-intake evaluation | [Date] | [Name] |

*This register is a governance control document. It must be treated as confidential internal documentation and made available to the DPO, Legal, and relevant regulatory authorities on request.*

> [LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED] Before this register is used operationally, a qualified lawyer must confirm: (i) the correct EU AI Act risk classification for each system; (ii) the data categories processed by each system; and (iii) whether any system triggers a mandatory DPIA under GDPR Article 35 or BDSG Section 67.
