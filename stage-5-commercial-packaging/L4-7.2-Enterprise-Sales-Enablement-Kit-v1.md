## 1. How to Use This Document

This document provides pre-drafted responses to common enterprise procurement, security, and regulatory questionnaires. Each answer references underlying governance framework documents and relevant regulatory provisions.

Sales teams should:

1. Adapt language only where necessary for client context.

## 2. Security Questionnaire Responses

### Q: How is data encrypted in transit and at rest?
**A:** All client communications are encrypted in transit using modern TLS protocols (minimum TLS 1.3) [ASSUMPTION]. Data at rest within hosting infrastructure is encrypted using industry-standard encryption mechanisms. These measures align with GDPR Article 32(1)(a), which requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

### Q: Do you use third-party sub-processors?
**A:** Yes, where required for hosting or AI model inference [ASSUMPTION]. All sub-processors are assessed under GDPR Article 28(2) and must enter into written agreements consistent with Article 28(3). Where international transfers occur, appropriate safeguards under Articles 44 and 46 are required.

### Q: How do you manage AI model provider risk?
**A:** Third-party model providers must execute GDPR Article 28-compliant DPAs and confidentiality agreements consistent with §43e BRAO. EU AI Act Article 25(4) requires written agreements across the AI value chain for high-risk systems.  
*Source: L2-5.3*

---

### Q: Do you log system activity?
**A:** Yes. High-risk systems implement automatic event logging in accordance with EU AI Act Article 12. Logging supports traceability, monitoring (Article 72), and incident response.

### Q: How do you prevent unauthorised automated decisions?
**A:** Systems are designed to require human lawyer review before any AI-generated output may form final legal advice. This addresses GDPR Article 22(1) and EU AI Act Article 14 human oversight requirements.  
*Source: L1-3.4*

---

### Q: Is there a formal change management process?
**A:** Yes. All changes are classified under a structured protocol. Substantial modifications (EU AI Act Article 3(23)) trigger reassessment and, where required, new conformity assessment under Article 43(4).  
*Source: L3-6.3*

---

### Q: How do you monitor model performance?
**A:** Performance metrics such as hallucination rate, error patterns, and user-reported concerns are monitored continuously. For high-risk systems, post-market monitoring is mandatory under Article 72.  
*Source: L3-6.1*

## 3. EU AI Act Compliance Responses

### Q: How do you determine AI system risk classification?

### Q: Are your systems subject to the EU AI Act prohibited practices list?
**A:** EU AI Act Article 5 prohibits specific AI practices including subliminal manipulation, exploitation of vulnerabilities, social scoring by public authorities, and real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces.
